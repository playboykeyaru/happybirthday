            <p>My Dearest Mina,<br></p>

                <p>Happy birthday, my love! Today is a day to celebrate the wonderful person you are. As writing this letter, my heart swells with love and gratitude for having you in my life.</p>
                <p>These last four months with you have been nothing short of magical. Each moment i spent by your side was filled with laughter, joy, and an overwhelming sense of happiness. You've brought light into my life in ways I never imagined possible and I am endlessly grateful for that.</p>
                <p>Mina, you are more than just my girlfriend; you are my best friend, my confidante, and my biggest supporter. Your unmatchable love and kindness have touched my soul in ways I cannot fully express. With you, I have found a sense of peace that i never knew existed.</p>
                <p>I want you to know just how much you mean to me. Your smile brightens even the darkest of days, and your laughter is like music to my ears, truly the best of melodies.</p>
                <p>As we celebrate your birthday today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the beautiful memories we've created together. From our late-night conversations to our little fun dates, each moment with you has been filled with love and laughter. I cherish every single memory we've shared and look forward to create more of them in the future.</p>
                <p>Happy birthday, my love. May this year be filled with endless love, laughter, and happiness. I love you more than words can express, and I look forward to sharing many more birthdays with you in the future.</p>
                <p>With all my love,</p>
                <p>Sami</p>
